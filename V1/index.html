        <p>Welcome to my website, my name is Austin Raffelock, and I've been playing games since I was probably about 4 or 5.
            This puts the start of my gaming career around 1999, and my first systems were a Nintendo64 and Gameboy color.
            This site is supposed to assist with recommendation of games from my own experiance along with reviews from those who visit this site.
