                 This is Version 3 Of my website, though I didn't submit A version 2, I still had made changes between versions
                 1, 2, and 3. They are as follows.
             </p>
             <h1>Version one</h1>
             <p>
                 The most simple version. About me had next to no info, Home page was very simple and not organized 
                 as wanted. No other pages but those two existed.
             </p>
             <h1>Version 2</h1>
             <p>
                 Page has been cleaned up slightly, no major changes outside of changing of placement of lists
             </p>
             <h1>Version 3</h1>
             <p>
                 Addition of recommendations page, as well as addition of information on about me page.
                 Changed how the pages refer to each other as well as included placebo code for Reviews page in the future.
                 Made a large table for recommended Games in recommendations page.
